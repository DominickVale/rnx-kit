# Contributing an RFC

Thank you for your interest in this project!

RFCs are submitted as pull-requests against the
["rfcs" branch](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit/tree/rfcs) of this
repository.

As a contributor, you're expected to follow the
[code of conduct](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributor License Agreement

RFC contributions may require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement
(CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether
you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check,
comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need
to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
